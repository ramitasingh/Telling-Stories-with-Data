# Cmu-student Portfolio
My Public Portfolio for the course **'Telling Stories with Data'**, Summer-2 :sunny:,2019

# About Me
Hi I'm Ramita, A.K.A *Rum* (nicknamed after my dad's favorite drink). I'm a graduate student studying Health Care Policy and Management at the Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University :mortar_board:. 
## My journey
I studied Biotechnology as an undergrad and got very attached to the field of Healthcare. I'm still exploring and trying to narrow down my options about what career path to take in Healthcare, and I hope to make that decision soon!

## My hobbies
I want to say I'm very outgoing in my free time, playing tennis and hiking and all that cool stuff, but lately I'm more of a **potato** glued to Netflix.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to improve my skills in choosing the right type of visualization, the appropriate pallet, how to highlight important data and filter the unnecessary ones and make data visualizations a concise and fun summary of the information I might have.

# Portfolio
This is my portfolio where I'll be adding everything I do! :dancers:

# Assignment 1
## Visualization of the popularity of the Left Party

“The Metamorphosis.” The Economist, August 13, 2016. https://www.economist.com/britain/2016/08/13/the-metamorphosis

Something I would consider would be including other parties like the British National Party for comparison. Candidates could be receiving far more likes in those parties and that could potentially be completely ignored with this data visualization.

## Data Visualization as a Journalist

I created this infographic from the point of view of a data journalist working for a daily newspaper like The New York Times that the general population reads (I'm mostly thinking about my dad reading his paper with his morning tea). I wanted to created a sort of visualization that would gauge the audience's interest on a topic they wouldn't have much information on. I also wanted to ensure I kept the tone of how serious the issue was. That's the main reason I decided to go with a black and white theme and not use any brightness or colors in the whole infograph. My secondary reason was that this would take up a lot of space, and with color, it would prove to be very expensive for a newspaper. There is a bit of red in the Map I've used but I feel like the extremely small amount would still be cheap and I personally feel it creates a big effect.

The facts from the report were quite overwhelming and I didn't want to try to incorporate all of it because the readers would get confused with the massive amount of information. I picked out a few numbers that would stand out and highlight the difficulties at the border. As a common reader the idea of 124%, a figure greater than a  100%, already brings up a red flag. I made sure the numbers were the main point by making them larger and bolder than the rest of the text. 
I also merged a lot of data together ( like the apprehensions > 72 hours and > 10 days) because it was getting the same point across either way, but having fewer portions and segments was easier on the eyes.

I played around a lot with the positioning of everything and I didn't like the typical text on one side, graphics on another idea because it was a) creating a lot of unnecessary space and b) just not looking visually appealing. So I incorporated a lot of what should have been the description text into the charts as well. I fit the 124% increase right into the gap that shows the increase and the 43% in the pie chart is both a label in the chart as well as part of it's description.

What bothers me is having both a pie chart and a semi-circle chart. It seems like too many arc type graphics but I didn't want to leave out either of those facts. 



## Critique of a data visualization from the US Census Bureau
### "How Likely Would You Be to Fill Out the Census Form?"

<a href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2019/comm/2020-census-participation-likelihood.html?cid=embedded_infographic" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2019/comm/2020-census-participation-likelihood/_jcr_content/map.detailitem.800.high.jpg/1548339754138.jpg" alt="How Likely Would You Be to Fill Out the Census Form?" width="612" height="648" title="How Likely Would You Be to Fill Out the Census Form?"/></a>[Source: U.S. Census Bureau]

I found this data visualization while I was exploring some Census data for my internship. The purpose of a visualization like this would probably be to encourage it's viewers to fill out the Census form. If I found myself to be a part of the category that leaned towards 'unlikely to fill out', I'd feel a sense of guilt about my stance. It's similar to a persuasive data visualization convincing people to vote.

While this was a comparitive visualization for different age groups, there was also an average column for what I'd assume had a purpose of giving the viewer a general idea of the overall population's likelihood to fill out the form. 

**Some things I liked about this chart**

I thought the column chart idea, while not my top pick, was quite easy to understand. I like that the different levels on the Likert scale were distinguished by differentiated colors!

**Some things I didn't like about this chart**
The average column: Since the groups were of different sample sizes, I personally don't like the idea of an overall average to compare to. I like comparing the different groups by themselves.
The color scheme: Since I felt the message of this chart was to indicate that the 'not likely' categories aren't the best ones, a color scheme that was more 'warning' in nature should have been used.
The percentage values of the 'Not at all likely' category: It was very oddly placed on the top and when I first saw it, I didn't quite realise what it represented


## Recreation of the US Census Bureau's visualization

<iframe title="How Likely Would You Be To Fill Out The Census Form?" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-tAdXX" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/tAdXX/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="244"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>

My first change was to use a bar chart instead of a column chart. I thought it was a lot easier to compare different categories of likeliness while looking at the age groups horizontally. 

My second huge change was to remove the Average column entirely. This was definitely a personal preference because I wanted the viewer to focus on comparing the different age groups to each other and not an overall average. I also feel that averages , on an average, are quite misleading and the bars individually would be more accurate.

Finally, I also changed the color scheme of the graph. Like I mentioned before, I felt that the message of this visualization was to increase awareness of the portion of the population unaccounted for in the census because of failure to fill out the form. The two 'unlikelier' categories are more red in color, which I feel connotes a more negative characteristic, and the likelier categories are greener, more positive.I'd personally not want to be associated with the red categories and would potentially fill out the form the next time to avoid it.

**Where I fell short**
The original column chart did not do a good job of placing the percentage values of the "Not at all likely" level. I wasn't able to find any way to improve on this because the values are so small compared to the other groups to fit into a segment of the bar.
In fact my visualization ended up not showing the percentage values at all for a couple of segments. It seems pretty obvious that they're less but I should have found a way to incorporate it.
