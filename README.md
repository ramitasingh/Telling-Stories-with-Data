# Cmu-student Portfolio
My Public Portfolio for the course **'Telling Stories with Data'**, Summer-2 :sunny:,2019

# About Me
Hi I'm Ramita, A.K.A *Rum* (nicknamed after my dad's favorite drink). I'm a graduate student studying Health Care Policy and Management at the Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University :mortar_board:. 
## My journey
I studied Biotechnology as an undergrad and got very attached to the field of Healthcare. I'm still exploring and trying to narrow down my options about what career path to take in Healthcare, and I hope to make that decision soon!

## My hobbies
I want to say I'm very outgoing in my free time, playing tennis and hiking and all that cool stuff, but lately I'm more of a **potato** glued to Netflix.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to improve my skills in choosing the right type of visualization, the appropriate pallet, how to highlight important data and filter the unnecessary ones and make data visualizations a concise and fun summary of the information I might have.

# Portfolio
This is my portfolio where I'll be adding everything I do! :dancers:
